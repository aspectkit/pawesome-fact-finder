# Facts you wish you knew!

## User Story

```
As a common household pet (dog/cat) enthusiast
I WANT a data base that will show me facts about each species.
SO THAT I can have a deeper understanding of both species.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage about cat/dog facts.
WHEN I view the webpage.
THEN I can find Cat or dog facts.
```

## Desctiption

This website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The sites function is to pull form API's that contain both facts and pictures of dogs and cats. This is done at random and prevents the same fact from appearing more than once. The user can push the Woof! button to receive a fact and a picture pertaining to dogs, or the user can select the MEOW! button to receive a fact and picture of cats. Finally, the user could select an "I'M FEELING LUCKY" button to receieve a popout of either dogs or cats.

**Who is the audience?**: The targeted audience is animal lovers that want to learn more interesting facts about our furry friends.

**What problem does it address, and how does it solve it?**: The problem addressed is the lack of an website where cat and dog lover can be provided with cat and dog facts. The problem is solved by creating an application that pulls from known databases to provide the user with a picture and a fact about either cats or dogs.

## Roadmap

We are currently planning to add more animals to the fact generator. This includes "but is not limited to" Birds, Lizards, and Fish.
